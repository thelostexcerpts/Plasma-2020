Received a WhatsApp message that contained the details of this internship. There were several topics to choose from (or research upon):
1. Nonlinear plasma physics
2. Plasma Astrophysics
3. Laser Plasma Interaction

On seeing the terms : "nonlinear", and "astrophysics" : my insides started jumping like a maniac. I needed to do this. Moreover, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, all internships stood cancelled. Therefore, this seemed to be a golden opportunity to gain a bit of research experience.

I replied to that message, and later was added to the Whatsapp group pertaining to the internship.

Oh my my... There are loads of participants. The reason being quite obvious: all internships viz. summer programs were cancelled. The one that hurt me the most was the summer program conducted by the Indian ACcademy of Sciences. It was cancelled too. :(

The program would commence from July 6.

Okay, the basic reading material was provided. 
I like how MIT is catering to the needs of thousands of students. Their OCW just rocks!!

I found the reading material to be a cent percent clone of MIT's "[Introduction to Plasma Physics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-611j-introduction-to-plasma-physics-i-fall-2003/index.htm)" course. As we were told, studying the entire range of topics wasn't, at all, necessary.

A week's time was given to us to get our gears working.
