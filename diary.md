Received a WhatsApp message that contained the details of this internship. There were several topics to choose from (or research upon):
1. Nonlinear plasma physics
2. Plasma Astrophysics
3. Laser Plasma Interaction

On seeing the terms : "nonlinear", and "astrophysics" : my insides started jumping like a maniac. I needed to do this. Moreover, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, all internships stood cancelled. Therefore, this seemed to be a golden opportunity to gain a bit of research experience.

I replied to that message, and later was added to the Whatsapp group pertaining to the internship.

Oh my my... There are loads of participants. The reason being quite obvious: all internships viz. summer programs were cancelled. The one that hurt me the most was the summer program conducted by the Indian ACcademy of Sciences. It was cancelled too. :(

The program would commence from July 6.

Okay, the basic reading material was provided. 
I like how MIT is catering to the needs of thousands of students. Their OCW just rocks!!

I found the reading material to be a cent percent clone of MIT's "[Introduction to Plasma Physics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-611j-introduction-to-plasma-physics-i-fall-2003/index.htm)" course. As we were told, studying the entire range of topics wasn't, at all, necessary.

A week's time was given to us to get our gears working.

Okay, one thing is clear. Instead of focussing on the physics of Plasma, we'd be only dealing with the mathematics revolving around it. Those PDEs look quite daunting, to be honest. 

One must have a firm understanding of Fluid Dynamics,and Electrodynamics (especially, Cyclotron Frequency and the related stuff). Since, the past few days, I've been reading about Debye Length, 2-fluid equations, why Plasma is called Plasma, et cetera. Since, the workshop/internship also deals with some astrophysical aspects of plasma, we're provided with a refresher on terms used in astronomy.

I ended up revising Blackbody Radiation, Stefan's Law, Wein's Displacement Law, a bit of Statistical Mechanics (especially, Photon Gas), and certain astronomical coordinate systems (I forget them everytime, poor memory LOL).

### July 8, 2020

The instructor/supervisor shared the first video. Certain basic stuff delaing with linearising equations.

---

### July 9, 2020

The first assignment is here. We're made to derive Linear Dispersion Relations, and Normalize certain systems.

---

### July 11, 2020

I couldn't figure out how to solve those assignments. I asked Shashank about a point that, I doubt, I wasn't able to grasp. Ohhh... the pieces fell into their respective places. Flashback of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator starts. After a small discussion with Shashank, I was able to solve the normalization assignment quite easily (although it was entensively calculative). The problem was quite similar to the Normalization of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (or some related quantum mechanical systems).

Completed the Linear Dispersion Relation assignment too. I came across pretty weird expressions which weren't linear at all. LOL!

---

### July 15, 2020

A new assignment dealing woth KdV equations is here. Pretty tough, and I think, we should be quite comfortable with Linear Dispersion relation before attempting this one.

---

### July 16, 2020

Submitted the KdV assignment. Was too lengthy. There were sooooo many equations to deal with simultaneously. It was easy but painfully hard, too many manipulations were to be done.

---

### July 18, 2020

Project choosing portal opens. We chose one on the easy intermediate end as we didn't want it to be theoretically or computationally extensive. The one that we eneded up pick was quite easy. We had to derive KdV and LDRs for the given system : Dust Ion Plasma. Also, we'd to plot certain relations concerning the same.

---

### July 22, 2020

I verified my DR and KdV calculations with Shashank's. Thank goodness, they finally matched!

---

### July 24, 2020

Certain simplifications on the Linear Dispersion Relation. Plotting of DR begins. 
My code (Python/Scilab) wasn't giving desired results, instead, it wasn't plotting the equation! I don't know why? 
Shashank ended up plotting these, and I ended up typesetting our project.

---

### July 28, 2020

Completed typesetting. Looks pretty awesome.

---

### July 30 - August 4, 2020

We're looking for apt introduction and Results for our project.

---

### August 5, 2020

So, I finally submitted dissertation today. And now, we have to start writing our paper that'd be published in the conference's journal.

---

### August 7, 2020

First draft of conference paper is ready.

---

### August 26-28, 2020

Finally, the conference paper is ready, got it verified by our Supervisor. It'd be out for publication soon. First Pulication. YAY!

---

### August 29, 2020

We as a team also registered ourselves for a poster presentation. 

---

### September 3- 10, 2020

The Plasma Colloquium begins (and ends). Was pretty enriching.

---

### Up Until Now

Eagerly waiting for the publication to come out.
