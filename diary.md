Received a WhatsApp message that contained the details of this internship. There were several topics to choose from (or research upon):
1. Nonlinear plasma physics
2. Plasma Astrophysics
3. Laser Plasma Interaction

On seeing the terms : "nonlinear", and "astrophysics" : my insides started jumping like a maniac. I needed to do this. Moreover, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, all internships stood cancelled. Therefore, this seemed to be a golden opportunity to gain a bit of research experience.

I replied to that message, and later was added to the Whatsapp group pertaining to the internship.

Oh my my... There are loads of participants. The reason being quite obvious: all internships viz. summer programs were cancelled. The one that hurt me the most was the summer program conducted by the Indian ACcademy of Sciences. It was cancelled too. :(

The program would commence from July 6.

Okay, the basic reading material was provided. 
I like how MIT is catering to the needs of thousands of students. Their OCW just rocks!!

I found the reading material to be a cent percent clone of MIT's "[Introduction to Plasma Physics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-611j-introduction-to-plasma-physics-i-fall-2003/index.htm)" course. As we were told, studying the entire range of topics wasn't, at all, necessary.

A week's time was given to us to get our gears working.

Okay, one thing is clear. Instead of focussing on the physics of Plasma, we'd be only dealing with the mathematics revolving around it. Those PDEs look quite daunting, to be honest. 

One must have a firm understanding of Fluid Dynamics,and Electrodynamics (especially, Cyclotron Frequency and the related stuff). Since, the past few days, I've been reading about Debye Length, 2-fluid equations, why Plasma is called Plasma, et cetera. Since, the workshop/internship also deals with some astrophysical aspects of plasma, we're provided with a refresher on terms used in astronomy.

I ended up revising Blackbody Radiation, Stefan's Law, Wein's Displacement Law, a bit of Statistical Mechanics (especially, Photon Gas), and certain astronomical coordinate systems (I forget them everytime, poor memory LOL).

The instructor/supervisor shared the first video. Certain basic stuff delaing with linearising equations.

The first assignment is here. We're made to derive Linear Dispersion Relations, and Normalize certain systems.

I couldn't figure out how to solve those assignments. I asked Shashank about a point that, I doubt, I wasn't able to grasp. Ohhh... the pieces fell into their respective places. Flashback of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator starts. After a small discussion with Shashank, I was able to solve the normalization assignment quite easily (although they were entensively calculative). The problem was quite similar to the Normalization of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (or some related quantum mechanical systems).
