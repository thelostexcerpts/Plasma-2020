Received a WhatsApp message taht contained the details of this internship. There were several topics to read(research upon):
1. Nonlinear plasma physics
2. Plasma Astrophysics
3. Laser Plasma Interaction

On seeing the terms : "nonlinear", and "astrophysics" : my insides started jumping like a maniac. I needed to do this. Moreover, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, all internships stood cancelled. Therefore, this seemed to be a golden opportunity to gain a bit of research experience.

I replied to that message, and later was added to the Whatsapp group specific to the internship.

Oh my my... There are loads of participants. The reason being quite obvious: all internships viz. summer programs were cancelled. The one that hurt me the most was the summer program conducted by the Indian ACcademy of Sciences. It was cancelled too. :(

The program would commence from July from July 6.
